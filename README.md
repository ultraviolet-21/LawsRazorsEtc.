# LawsRazorsEtc.
A fun program where you can learn about various philosophical laws, paradoxes, and razors. 

All statements (40 total) are in the file LawsRazorsEtc.txt. Using the random_laws function, the user can generate n statement from the list. The user can also generate a single statement using random_law; this will only return the statement itself and not its name. The guessing_game will present n statements, and the user will have to guess the name of the law. Then, it will return the score. Some of the statements, usually the paradoxes, are actually questions. The function answer_questions allows the user to write their own answers to the paradoxes. These answers will be stored in a file determined by the user.
